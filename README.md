This is a full-stack MERN application for managing expenses. It includes a frontend built with React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, and a backend built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application allows users to create an account, log in, and manage their expenses by adding, updating, and deleting transactions. The application also includes a dashboard for viewing transaction history and statistics. The application is secured with JSON Web Tokens and password hashing.

### Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration using JSON Web Tokens.
- **CRUD Operations:** Add, update, and delete transactions and categories.
- **Dashboard:** Visualize transaction history and statistics.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for mobile and desktop views.
- **API Integration:** Seamless interaction with backend services using Axios.

This project is a full-stack MERN application for managing expenses. It includes a frontend built with React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, and a backend built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application allows users to create an account, log in, and manage their expenses by adding, updating, and deleting transactions. The application also includes a dashboard for viewing transaction history and statistics. The application is secured with JSON Web Tokens and password hashing.

The frontend was built with React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. It uses a token-based authentication system, with a secure login and registration system. The application uses a reducer to manage the state of the application, and a set of actions to interact with the reducer. The application is also fully responsive, with a responsive design built with Tailwind CSS. The application is also fully accessible, with features such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

The backend was built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The backend uses a token-based authentication system, with a secure login and registration system. The backend also uses a set of middleware functions to interact with the database, and to secure the application. The backend is also fully scalable, with a horizontally scalable architecture built with Node.js.

The application is also secured with JSON Web Tokens and password hashing. The application uses a secure password hashing algorithm, with a salted hash of the password. The application also uses a secure token-based authentication system, with a JSON Web Token signed with a secret key.

   - Run `npm start` to start the backend server.

3. **Frontend Setup**:

   - Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
   - Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend development server.

4. **Access the Application**:

   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
   - Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
   - Use the dashboard to manage your expenses by adding, updating, or deleting transactions.

5. **Deployment**:
   - To deploy the application, build the frontend using `npm run build` in the `frontend` directory.
